# personal-website-music
Hello! My name is Rajiv Chevannes, currently I am a Junior at Florida International University studying Computer Science. 
This is my first attempt creating a personal website, I will be experimenting to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The inspiration is taken from popular music apps currently available on the app and play store. This project is not affiliated with any of the apps recreated and is just a fun project to learn more about css and to practice. 

I'm pretty sure there's a way for github to host your webstie but am not completely sure of the process, will be looking into that later...
